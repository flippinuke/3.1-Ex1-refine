3.1 - Exercise 1: Basic Data Manupulation

I've encountered an interesting quirk:

When running the code, please pay attention to line 38. You will notice that RStudio produces an error message for each line of code that you run from lines 41 to 45. If you go back and run the code on line 38 a second time, you will be able to run lines 41-45 with no problem.

Alternatively, you can run the code on line 38 twice, and there will be no error message produced when you run code on lines 41-45
